Code to find percolation threshold, number of clusters and number of percolating paths for an n-dimensional square lattice using HK algorithm.

N.B.
Use percolatefind00.m to count n(paths) at percolation threshhold (p_c), I removed the path counting bit from the dataextraction script the last time I ran the code, so might need to make trivial modifications in other files to include this 'no. of paths' info.
